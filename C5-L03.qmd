## Learning Objectives

-   [x] Write down the location mixture of AR models under Bayesian conjugate setting. Specify the likelihood function and prior distribution.
-   [x] Derive the full conditional distributions and develop the Gibbs sampler for posterior inference of model parameters.
-   [x] Implement in the R environment Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for fitting mixture models.
