## Homework - Conditional Probability and Bayes' Law

[Titanic data]{.colum-margin} I put the data from the Titanic for this problem into a .csv file and loaded it into a data frame as follows:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv("data/titanic.csv",index_col='class')
print(df) 
```

::: {#exr-cpb-1}
[Titanic data]{.colum-margin} If we randomly select a person's name from the complete list of passengers and crew, what is the probability that this person traveled in 1st class? Round your answer to two decimal places.
:::

::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:

```{python}
def l02q01(df):
    return  round(df.loc[1].sum() / df.values.sum(),2)
l02q01(df)
```
:::

::: {#exr-cpb-2}
[Titanic data]{.colum-margin} What is the probability that a (randomly selected) person survived? Round your answer to two decimal places.
:::

::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:

```{python}

def l02q02(df):
    return  round(df.survived.sum() / df.values.sum(),2)

l02q02(df)
```

::: {#exr-cpb-3}
[Titanic data]{.colum-margin} What is the probability that a (randomly selected) person survived, given that they were in 1st class? Round your answer to two decimal places.
:::

::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:

```{python}

def l02q03(df):
    return round(
        df.loc[1,'survived'].sum() /
        df.loc[1,].sum(),
        2)

l02q03(df)
```

::: {#exr-cpb-4}
[Titanic data]{.colum-margin} True/False: The events concerning class and survival are statistically independent.
:::

::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:

False

[Marbles data]{.colum-margin} You have three bags, labeled A, B, and C. Bag A contains two red marbles and three blue marbles. Bag B contains five red marbles and one blue marble. Bag C contains three red marbles only.

again I put the data for this into a CSV file and loaded it as follows

```{python}
import pandas as pd

mdf=pd.read_csv("data/marbles.csv",index_col='bag')
print(mdf) 
```

::: {#exr-cpb-5}
[Marbles data]{.colum-margin} If you select from bag B, what is the probability that you will draw a red marble?
:::

::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:

```{python}

def l02q05(df):
    p = {}
    p['red n b'] = df.loc['b','red'].sum() / df.loc['b',].sum()
    
    print(f"p['red n b'] = {df.loc['b','red'].sum()} / {df.loc['b',].sum()} = {p['red n b']}")        

l02q05(mdf)
```
:::

::: {#exr-cpb-6}
[Marbles data]{.colum-margin} If you randomly select one of the three bags with equal probability, so that $P(A)=P(B)=P(C)=1/3$, and then randomly draw a marble from that bag, what is the probability that the marble will be blue? Round your answer to two decimal places.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Hint

This is the marginal probability $P(blue)$. You can obtain this using the `law of total` probability (which appears in the denominator of Bayes' theorem). It is

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(blue) &= P(blue \cap A) + P(blue \cap B) + P(blue \cap C) 
    \\      &= P(blue \mid A) \cdot P(A)+P(blue \mid B)\cdot P(B) + P(blue \mid C) \cdot P(C)
    \end{aligned}
$$

[Marbles data]{.colum-margin} Suppose a bag is randomly selected (again, with equal probability), but you do not know which it is. You randomly draw a marble and observe that it is blue. What is the probability that the bag you selected this marble from is A? That is, find $P(A∣blue)$.
