X is distributed as

$$X
\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

X is proportional to

$$
X\propto N(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

Probability of A and B

$$

$$

Conditional probability

$$

$$

Joint probability

$$
P(X,Y)
$$

$$
Y_i \stackrel{iid}\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

Approximately distributed as (say using the CLT)

$$
Y_i \stackrel{.}\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_i]
$$

The **expected value** of an RV X set to 0 (A.K.A. a fair bet)

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_i]  \stackrel{set} = 0
$$

The variance of an RV

$$\mathbb{V}ar[X_i]$$

independence

$$
A \perp \!\!\! \perp B \iff P(A \mid B) = P(A)
$$

Indicator function
$$
\mathbb{I}_{\{A\}} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } A \text{ is true} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

Dirichlet function

This is a continuous version of the indicator function, defined as a limit.

$$
\delta(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \mathbb{I}_{\{|x| < \epsilon\}}
$$

The Dirichlet function is used to represent a point mass at a point, often used as a component for zero inflated mixtures.


The following are from course 4


-   $\{y_t\}$ - the time series process, where each $y_t$ is a univariate random variable and t are the time points that are equally spaced. 
-   $y_{1:T}$ or $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_T$ - the observed data.
- You will see the use of ' to denote the transpose of a matrix,
- and the use of $\sim$ to denote a distribution.
- under tildes $\utilde{y}$ are used to denote estimates of the true values $y$.
- E matrix of eigenvalues
- $\Lambda = diagonal(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots , \alpha_p)$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of Î£ on the diagonal.
- $J_p(1)$ = a p by p Jordan form matrix with 1 on the superdiagonal
