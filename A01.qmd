parameters are with Greek letters

$$\theta$$

estimate $$\hat{p}$$

the Certain event

$$\Omega$$

probability of RV x taking value x

$$P(X=x)$$

odds $$\mathcal{O}(X)$$

random variables $$X$$

X is distributed as

$$X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$

X is proportional to

$$X\propto N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$

Probability of A and B

$$P(X \cap Y)$$

Conditional probability

$$P(X \mid Y)$$

Joint probability

$$P(X,Y)$$

$$Y_i \stackrel{iid}\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$

Approximately distributed as (say using the CLT)

$$Y_i \stackrel{.}\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$

$$\mathbb{E}[X_i]$$

The **expected value** of an RV X set to 0 (A.K.A. a fair bet)

$$\mathbb{E}[X_i]  \stackrel{set} = 0$$

The variance of an RV

$$\mathbb{V}ar[X_i]$$

logical implication

$$\implies$$

if and only if

$$\iff$$

therefore

$$\therefore$$

independence

$$A \perp \!\!\! \perp B \iff P(A \mid B) = P(A)$$
