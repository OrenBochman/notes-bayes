The Moore-Penrose inversion and the Cholesky decomposition are two important methods in linear algebra for solving linear equations efficiently. They are widely used in various applications, including statistics, machine learning, and numerical analysis.

## Moore-Penrose Inversion {#sec-moore-penrose}

The Moore-Penrose inversion is a method for computing the pseudoinverse of a matrix. The pseudoinverse is a generalization of the inverse of a matrix that can be used to solve linear equations when the matrix is rectangular, not-invertible or even singular.

## Definition of the Moore-Penrose Inverse 1

The Moore–Penrose inverse of the m × n matrix A is the n × m
matrix, denoted by A+ , which satisfies the conditions

$$
AA+ A = A
$$ {#eq-moore-penrose-1}

$$  
A^+AA^+ = A^+
$$ {#eq-moore-penrose-2}

$$
(AA^+ )' = AA^+ 
$$ {#eq-moore-penrose-3}

$$
(A^+A)' = A^+A
$$ {#eq-moore-penrose-4}

An important features of the Moore–Penrose inverse, is that it is uniquely defined.


Corresponding to each m × n matrix A, one and only one n × m matrix $A^+$ exists satisfying conditions (@eq-moore-penrose-1)–(@eq-moore-penrose-4).

Definition @def-moore-penrose-inverse-1 is the definition of a generalized inverse given by Penrose (1955).

The following alternative definition, which we will find useful on some occasions,
utilizes properties of the Moore–Penrose inverse that were first illustrated by Moore (1935).

## Definition of the Moore-Penrose Inverse 2

Let A be an m × n matrix. Then the Moore–Penrose inverse of A is
the unique n × m matrix A+ satisfying

$$
AA^+ = P_{R(A)}
$$ {#eq-moore-penrose-5}

$$
A^+ A = P_{R(A^+)}
$$ {#eq-moore-penrose-6}

where $P_{R(A)}$ and $P_{R(A^+)}$ are the projection matrices of the range spaces of $A$ and $A^+$,
respectively.

## Properties of the Moore-Penrose inverse 

Let A be an $m \times n$ matrix. Then:

a. $(αA)^+ = α^{-1} A^+ , \text{ if } \alpha \ne 0 \text{ is a scalar}$
b. $(A^T)^+ = (A^+)^T$ 
c. $(A^+)^+ = A$
d. $A^+ = A^{-1} ,\text{if A is square and nonsingular}$
e. $(A^T A)^+ = A^+ A^T$ and $(AA^T)^+ = A^T A^+$
f. $(AA^+)^+ = AA^+$ and $(A^+ A)^+ = A^+ A$
g. $A^+ = (A^T A)^+ A^T = A^T (AA^T)^+$
h. $A^+ = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T$ and $A^+ A = I_n , \text{ if } rank(A) = n$
i. $A^+ = A^T (AA^T)^{-1}$ and $AA^+ = I_m , \text{ if } rank(A) = m$
j. $A^+ = A^T$  if the columns of A are orthogonal, that is, $A^T A = I_n$

##  Rank of Moore-Penrose Inverse

For any $m \times n$ matrix $A$, $\text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}(A^+) = \text{rank}(AA^+) = \text{rank}(A^+ A)$.
