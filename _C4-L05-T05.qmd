We will now see how to obtain the spectral density of an
autoregressive process. Also how to look at
posterior distributions of the spectral densities of this AR process just based
on data that we have. The first thing I'm going
to do here is again, I'm going to simulate some data from an autoregressive
process of order 2. This process has one pair of complex valued reciprocal
roots with modulus 0.95 and period 12. In this case, I'm just going to do what
we've done before, which is just simulate 300 observations from
this AR(2) process. Based on this
model order of two, we can obtain the maximum
likelihood estimators for the AR coefficients and also the unbiased
estimator for v, which we call s2. Based on these, we can obtain 200 samples from the posterior distribution
using direct simulation. We've done this before. Again, I'm going
to be sampling v from the inverse
Gamma distribution, and then conditional on v, I can obtain samples for the Phi using the
bivariate normal. Based on these estimates
or these samples, I can just look at what is the spectral density
of this process. I'm going to use the
spec.ar function. You just pass the data, you specify the model order, and then it just uses estimates. The maximum likelihood
estimator of this AR process for
the coefficients and the variance and then it
does the transformation to obtain this estimate of
the spectrum density. You can use the
function spec.ar, and then R automatically produces this estimate
of the spectral density. As you can see for this process, the process is going
to be quasiperiodic. There is going to be a
peak at the periodicity. In this case the periodicity is 12 because that's how we
simulated the process. You can also use another
function that is called arma.spec from the
as time series, astsa package, to draw
the spectral density. I'm going to also
illustrate this here. If you want to use this, you call this library. The good thing with
this function is that you can pass
your estimates, whatever are your estimates, for the AR coefficients
and for the variance. In particular here, passing the maximum
likelihood estimator based on the conditional likelihood
for the AR coefficients. Then for the variance
of the error terms, I'm just passing the s2, the s squared. But you can pass any
other estimator. It could be a posterior sample. It could be anything else. Then we obtain this again. This is a figure that is very similar to the
one we had before, just plotting the
spectral density. Again, we see that the power
spectrum has this peek at the quasi periodic component
with periodicity 12. We can also pass, as I said, this function, the nice thing is that
it allows you to pass any estimates or any values for the Phis and the variance. In this case, I'm just passing samples from the
posterior distribution. For each of the samples of the posterior
distribution that I have, I can just compute
this arma.spec, this estimate of the
spectral density. This takes a little bit to
compute because we have a few samples here and it has to do the calculations for
each of those samples. Then based on the results, you can then plot. For each of those samples, you obtain a spectral density and for each of those
spectral densities, you can plot essentially the corresponding
spectral density. For each of those
samples that you have for the AR coefficients
and the variance, you're going to get one of this samples for the
spectral density. I'm just plotting here
these as a distribution. Then the solid line here corresponds to the
maximum likelihood estimator. The dotted line corresponds to the true value in the
sense of where the peak of the log spectral density should be and it corresponds
to a period of 12, which is consistent with what we obtain in terms of
the posterior distribution.
