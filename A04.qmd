# Indicator Functions {#sec-indicator-functions}

The concept of an indicator function is a really useful one. This is a function that takes the value one if its argument is true, and the value zero if its argument is false. Sometimes these functions are called Heaviside functions or unit step functions. I write an indicator function as $\mathbb{I}_{A}(x)$, although sometimes they are written $\mathbb{1}_{A}(x)$. If the context is obvious, we can also simply write $I{A}$.

Example:

$$
    \mathbb{I}_{x>3}(x)=
    \begin{cases}
      0, & \text{if}\ x \le 3 \\
      1, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
$$

Note: Indicator functions are easy to implement in code using a `lambda function`. They can be combined using a dictionary.

Because 0 · 1 = 0, the product of indicator functions can be combined into a single indicator function with a modified condition.

### Products of Indicator Functions:

$$
    \mathbb{I}{x<5} \cdot \mathbb{I}{x≥0} = \mathbb{I}{0≤x<5}
$$

$$
    \prod_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}_{(x_i<2)} = \mathbb{I}_{(x_i<2) \forall i} = \mathbb{I}_{\max_i x_i<2}
$$
