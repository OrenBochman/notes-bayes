#  The ArgMax function {#sec-appendix-the-argmax-function}

When we want to maximize a function $f(x)$, there are two things we may be interested in:

1.  The value $f(x)$ achieves when it is maximized, which we denote $\max_x f(x)$.
2.  The x-value that results in maximizing $f(x)$, which we denote $\hat x = \arg \max_x f(x)$. Thus $\max_x f(x) = f(\hat x)$.
