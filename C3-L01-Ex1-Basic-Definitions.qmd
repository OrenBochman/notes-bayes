1. Which one of the following is not the density of a well defined mixture distribution with support on $x \ge 1$
x

- [ ] $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\ e^{-x} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp^{-0.5x^2}$

- [ ] $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\ e^{-x} + \frac{1}{4}\ e^{-x}$

- [x] $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\ e^{-x} + \frac{1}{2}\ e^{- 0.5 x}$


Hint: the key here is to write the mixtures with the weights and the normalization constant clearly separated. This reveals that the last one is not a well defined mixture distribution because the weights do not sum to 1 while the the second answer is!

2. What is the expected value of a random variable X whose distribution is a mixture of Poisson distributions of the form

$$
f(x) = 0.3 \frac{2^x e^{-2}}{x!}  + 0.45 \frac{2^x e^{-3}}{x!} + 0.25 \frac{.5^x e^{-0.5}}{x!}
$$ {#eq-poisson-mixture}

:::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:

$$
E(X) = 0.3 \cdot 2 + 0.45 \cdot 3 + 0.25 \cdot 0.5 = 2.075
$$

3. What is the variance of an RV $X$ whose distribution is a mixture of Poisson distributions of the form [@eq-poisson-mixture] ?

$$
E(X^2) = 0.3 \cdot (2+2^2 ) + 0.45 \cdot (3+3^2) + 0.25 \cdot (0.5 + 0.5^2)= 7.3875
$$

:::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:
$$
Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = 7.3875 - (2.075)^2 = 3.081875
$$
