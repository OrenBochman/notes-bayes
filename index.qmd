title: "Introduction to Bayesian Statistics"
---

These are my notes on Bayesian Statistics. They are based on online courses I took after I worked as a Data Scientist for a number of years. Over this time I have often felt that if I was better at statistics I could overcome limitations in the data with mathematics, build even better models, and perhaps most importantly make better inferences using models I have already developed.

I tried to review the main results in statistics and probability theory, and I started to get better results and so I decided to take some classes. I often felt that the material was introductory and simplistic. Real world problems are monsters and the examples are usually trivial in comparison. The issues raised in class are rarely the troubles I saw at work. But I do believe deep down that the two are somehow related. And indeed as I covered more material certain aspects began to connect.

I noticed that like in real classes the teachers made mistakes, their motivation was not always clear and that they skipped steps or referred to certain results. On the other hand each teacher offered different insights into this complicated area of data analysis.

I therefore have a number main areas of Focus:

1.  What are the questions one should ask
2.  What are the explicit details of each examples or problem.
3.  What is the mathematical representation of the model for these
4.  What is the code representation for this in R and in Python.
5.  Can I find or create diagrams to make interpretation of probabilities clearer.
6.  Can I annotate the main equations to break them down.
7.  Can I keep track of the most useful Mathematical results in Probability and Statistics?
    1.  I tried to keep these handy as appendices to keep the main material less cluttered. However as time goes by these keep expanding.
8.  Can I learn to communicate my intuitions of these concepts to laymen and to colleagues
    1.  Some courses have *discussion prompts*, but I tried to make the most of these, and included them in these notes.
    2.  I realized that while I often get excited about a new paper or technique my colleges are smart and talented people and quickly ask questions that are difficult to answer. These question often indicate gaps of knowledge which can dampen the enthusiasm for implementing these new ideas.
    3.  I found that good communicators can overcome these issues more readily and connect what they already know.

I have often found exercises rather easy to solve and so I often breezed through them with little notice. This time I resolved to make the most of these as opportunities to get better at using and manipulating probabilities and posterior distributions. So although I could get around 75% in each exercises based on intuition I took the extra effort to understand what is realty going on here mathematically.

At work one of the main challenges is making the problem conform to a simple model. This can be even more challenging when the goal is a **latent** (unobserved) variable or when you are considering a synergy of **multiple effects** and you have seen and unseen **confounds**. In many cases it is unclear how to proceed based on the simple examples we see in these classes. However I am now able to look at the problems with more critical point of view. Also I see great advantages of a quick expositions to many new simple models. In Bayesian hierarchical framework each can become a link to adding just a little more complexity, integrating new types of prior information and so on. So I view these as jumping boards for overcoming my next challenges.
