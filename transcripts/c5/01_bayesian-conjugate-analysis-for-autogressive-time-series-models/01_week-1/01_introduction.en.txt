Hello, my name is Chi Joe Kao. I am a doctoral student of statistics at
the University of California Santa Cruz. It is my great pleasure to present you
the final course on Bayesian statistics. The capstone project,
welcome to the class. In this course, I will help you start from the very beginning to accomplish
a data analysis project. We will focus on a specific type of data,
the time series data. This course will introduce a kind of
mixture model for the time series data. We will teach you how to make posterior
inference for the mixture model and assess its improvement compared
with the single component model. To succeed in this course, you should
be familiar with the basic concepts and techniques in Bayesian statistics
as some knowledge it makes for models and time series analysis. Suppose you feel that you need to
strengthen your background in this area. In that case, I highly recommend that you
consider taking the previous courses in the series, such as Bayesian statistics,
from concept to data by Herbert Lee. Bayesian statistics, techniques and
models by Matthew Heiner, mixture model by Abel Rodriguez and
time series analysis by Raquel Prado. But don't worry,
this course is self consistent. We will review essential concepts and skills as the two come
necessary in our work. Throughout this course,
where we'll be dealing with two specific data set which can
be found in the first module. The first dataset consists of annual
number of worldwide earthquakes with magnetic field greater than seven. So the second dataset is a way
click Google search index data of the word co-ed in United States. Please follow the instructions
on how to use the data. You will have a chance to
practice on both data set, but you will write a final project report for
one data set of your choice. Now, let me give you an overview
of how the course is structured. There are four modules, in the first
module, we will start with fitting an autoregressive model to the time
series data, we will focus on performing a Bayesian control gait
analysis for the auto regressive model. For the second module, we will introduce model selection
criteria such as AIC, PIC, and DIC. This criteria will play a key role
in determining which model we should finally use for the data. The third module is a core of this course. We will study the mixture autoregressive
model, how to build a case sampler to inform model parameters and predict
future values under the mixture model. The last module contains only
a pure review assignment. Its your opportunity to bring together
all the pieces we have built throughout this course and communicate your
result through a written report. The peer review assignment,
is also a great chance, to get feedback, on your work and
help others, to improve their work. In the Coursera framework,
we provide the homework problems, as quizzes, will provide detailed
instructions on each quiz problem. But feel free to explore
the problems beyond what it asks. We will benefit from it again
when it comes to course. We hope this will be a fruitful journey. Good luck.
