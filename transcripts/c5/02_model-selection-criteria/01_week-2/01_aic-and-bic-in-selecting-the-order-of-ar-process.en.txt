To figure our air model
to some real data we need to took determining
the order of the air process. One possible way is to repeat the analysis for
different values of model order p and choose the best model based
on some criteria. The two most widely
known [inaudible] use the criteria are the so-called Akaike
information criteria, AIC and the Bayesian
Information criteria, BIC. We now describe how
to select the older of air process using AIC or BIC. Suppose we still have
data y_1/ T. As we are comparing models with
different numbers of parameters reduced so based
on a common sample size. Thus, we fix a
maximum older p star, and we consider p that is
less than or equal to p star. When compare models
of various other p less or equal to p star, we do so using the
letter n equals to T minus p star of iterations
in the time series. For any other p less
than or equal to p star, the ARP model can be written as y equals to f transpose
Phi plus Epsilon. Here y is our data. It is running from y_ p star
plus 1 dot dot dot to y_T. The design matrix F. The first column
is a design vector corresponding to the first
term y p star plus y here. It will start from y_p
star as y_p star minus 1 dot-dot-dot to y_p
star minus p plus 1. Remember we are fitting
our ARP process. The first column
should have P element. That's why we end at p
star minus p plus 1. As similarly, the second
column will be y_p star plus 1 y_p star dot dot dot
y_p star minus p plus 2. For the last column, we have the design vector for y_T which should be y_T minus 1, y_T minus 2 dot dot
dot y_T minus p. There are p rows in the F matrix and T minus p star
columns in the F matrix. F is a p by n matrix. The air coefficients Phi
is just Phi 1 Phi 2, to Phi p. The error term, if so, follows a normal
distribution which mean zero and variance matrix no
times the identity matrix. Then paste the Arbor notation. The conditional likelihood is f y_p star plus 1 to T condition of the
air coefficients Phi, the various parameter Nu
and y_1 up to p star. This is a multivariate
normal distribution. It's normal of mean, F transpose times Phi and variance no times
the identity matrix. A F Phi is defined here. If we plucking the
density function for the multivariate normal, we have further expand this as two Pi Nu to the power of negative 1 or 2
times exponential, negative 2 times Nu. As for the numerator, we have y minus F transpose Phi transpose
times y minus F transpose Phi. Use the trick you
may have seen in any linear regression class with define Phi hat as F, F transpose inverse
times F times y. We can expand this term, y minus F transpose Phi transpose y minus
F transpose Phi. Using the trick of hiding, subtract this term and
adding this term back. This is equal to y minus F transpose Phi hat plus F transpose Phi hat and
minus F transpose Phi. This whole thing transpose times y minus F transpose Phi hat plus F transpose Phi hat
and minus F transpose Phi. Here we're just minus this F transpose Phi hat
and press it back. This right-hand side equals
to the left-hand side. This further equals to, if we consider this part
and this part separately, this equals to y minus F transpose Phi hat transpose times y minus
F transpose Phi hat plus Phi hat minus Phi times F times F transpose
times Phi hat minus Phi. The cross product
term will vanish because of the orthogonal
projection property. Let us call this first part R. The definition of AIC
and BIC is given by, AIC equals to 2 times p, which is the order
of the air process, plus the number
of observations n times log R over n minus p. BIC is defined as log n times p plus n times log R over n minus p. Notice the second term of
AIC and BIC are the same. It is a measurement
of the good-of-fit. The difference is only
in the first term, which serves the
role of punishing the model with too
many parameters. Values of p leaving too small AIC and
BIC values are taken as indicative of relatively
good model fits. We've seen a ton of air
models so explored. Larger values of p
will tend to give smaller various
estimates which decrease this good-of-fit term
in both expressions. But this decrease
is penalized of parameter dimensions
by the first term. BIC tends to choose
simpler models than AIC. We simulate an air process
of order 2 and implement the AIC and BIC criteria to check if the best model
selected has order 2. Firstly, this code simulates an AR2 process with
100 observations. Process is simulated
with this formula, and it is shown here. Now, we fix p star at 15 and
since capital T is a 100, we will use the latter 85
observations for the analysis. We will compute and
plot both AIC and BIC for different values
of p ranging from 1-15. In terms of coding, we set up our n.all, which is a capital
T in our notation, p.star y, n, and p at the beginning. Now, let's take a look at
the formula for AIC and BIC. It requires the
calculation of R, which has this form. To calculate R, we need Phi hat. If we plucking a form
of Phi hat to R, R will be only upon the design
matrix F and our data y. In addition, the
design matrix F is the only term that will be
changed with respect to AR or the p. Data y is always fixed because no
matter which order we use, we will always use the letter
t minus p star as our data. The key step will be to get this design matrix
F with respect to different p. This is done by this function called
design.matrix. It defines the design
matrix row-by-row. For the S row, from this form of F, it will start from y
p star minus i plus 1 and the last will be n. The last term will be
y star plus n minus 1. For example, let's do
a simple check here. If we want to define
the first rule, that is i equals to 1, then y star will be p
star plus 1 and minus 1. That is just a p star. The last term is p
star plus n minus 1. Remember p star plus n
is just a capital T, so the last term is T minus 1. Therefore, the first row is
y from p star to T minus 1, which is exactly the first
row of F we have here. After we calculate
the design matrix, the following calculation for AIC and BIC is quite
straightforward. For each order p cur, we first get a
corresponding design matrix using the formula
we just defined, then calculate for
half R AIC and BIC using these formulas
and these codes. Finally, this function
returns the AIC and BIC values corresponding
to the order p cur. We apply this function to all P values we
want to consider, which is from 1-15 in this case. The result is plotting here. Since for AIC and
BIC criteria we both prefer model with smallest
criteria from the plot, we will use p equals 2, which is same as the order
we use to simulate the data.
