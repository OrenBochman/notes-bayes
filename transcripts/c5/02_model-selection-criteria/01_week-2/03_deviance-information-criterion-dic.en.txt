In this video, we will talk about DIC. DIC is a somewhat patient version of AIC. We will use DIC later to determine
the number of missing component after introducing the mixture
air model for time series. Suppose we have some data y and we assume y is generated
from some distribution, y condition parameter theta for
our air model, y follows a normal
distribution of y with mean F transpose times Coefficients phi and whereis mu times the identity matrix. Here, in the Model the parameters theta
is actually the Coefficients phi and various parameter mu. The general formula for calculating DIC arises from the modal estimation of expected lock density, cefined as elpd DIC this equals to the log of likelihood p (y)
condition theta hat base Minus 2, sorry minus PDIC. Here, theta hat this is equal to, the
expectation of theta giving the data y, which is just a posterior mean
of the parameters theta PDIC is the effective number of parameters
defined as PDIC equals to two times this lock likelihood block p of y
conditional theta hat base minus the expectation over the post here
of loc p(y) conditional theta This expectation is an average of theta or
a posterior distribution, which you really do not have close to form solution, but
we can calculate it in a Monte Carlo way. That is, we use posterior samples
of parameters theta to calculate. Suppose the posterior
sample of model parameters theta is denoted as theta s
running from one to capital S. So this computed PDIC. It's just the 2 times this
part remains the same, log p(y) conditional theta hat base Minus 1 over capital S, sum of small s running from 1 to capital S log p(f )y conditional theta s The actual quantity called DSC, is defined in terms of the theories
rather than the log predictive density. That is DIC equals to -2 times this log likelyhood (y) conditional theata hat base plus 2 times PDIC. With these two terms defined above,
in these two lines, we will give our code example of
calculate DIC, in the next video. We use the same simulated data as
an example to illustrate how we can compute DIC in r, the first step will be to generate
posterior samples of model parameters. Because the whole
calculation of DSC is based on the posterior distribution
of model parameters. From previous analysis, we already know we should fit our
Two model to the simulated data. Using the patient control analysis of
air model learned from the first module, we fit Two model with this
prior hyper parameter choice. Here we often find Southern posterior
samples and plot their distribution. The following code is just copied from
what we have learned in week one. Now let's consider calculate
the first part of ASC, in our Model, it has this form. Therefore, in terms of coding,
we define this function to calculate the log likelihood,
it takes in values of phi and nu and returns the log likelihood for
the whole data set. For the first part, we should pluck
in the posterior mean of phi and nu. So we just first calculate them and then call this log likelihood
function to compute. The second term PDIC can
be calculated in this way. Notice for the second term, the part
inside the summation is same as before. So we're just plugging every pyre
of posterior samples phi s and new s into the log likelihood function. It is done by this s apply function. So we need to compute the mean of them. Now PDIC is calculated
using this line of code. Finally, the DIC is compute by
its definition showing here. DIC is a modal comparison criteria, its
value may not be very useful by itself. But later on when we also compute
the assay for serum mixture models, we can compare the DIC value for
every model and select the best model by choosing
the model with the smallest DIC.
