If both mu and sigma squared are unknown, we can specify a conjugate prior
in a hierarchical fashion. The data X sub I,
given mu and sigma squared. We represent as independent identically
distributed normals with mean mu and variants sigma squared. We then specify a prior from mu
conditional on the value for sigma squared to be normal with mean M and
variance, sigma squared over W. It depends on sigma squared. In this case here,
W is going to be the ratio of sigma squared and some variance for
the normal distribution. This is the effective
sample size of the prior. Finally, the last step is to
specify a prior for sigma squared. The conjugate prior here is
an inverse gamma distribution, and we give it parameters alpha and beta. Lots of calculations later, we can get
a posterior, sigma squared given X. Follows an inverse gamma distribution
with parameters alpha plus N over two, and beta, plus one half times the sum
of X sub I, minus X bar squared. Plus N times W, over two times N plus W,
times X bar minus M squared. Post your distribution for mu, given sigma
squared, follows a normal distribution with mean NX bar plus WM, over N plus W. And variance sigma squared over N plus W. So it explicitly depends on sigma squared. Note that this posterior mean,
can be written, [SOUND]
as the weighted average of the prior mean and the data mean. Again, we see that W is the effective
sample size in this prior. In some cases, we really only care
about mu at the end of the day. We want inference on mu and we may want it such that it
doesn't depend on sigma squared. We can marginalize that sigma squared,
integrating it out. And at the end of the day,
we get a posterior for mu marginally, that follows a T distribution. Similarly, the posterior predictive
distribution also is a T distribution. Finally, I note that we can extend this in
various directions, this is going to be extended to the multivariate normal case,
that requires vector and matrix notation. This can also be extended in
a hierarchical fashion if we want to specify prior strain of M,
W, and beta.
