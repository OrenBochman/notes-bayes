This is the conclusion of this course. As you've seen, both Frequentist and
Bayesian approaches offer coherent methods for understanding of uncertainty and
for data analysis. I hope that I've convinced you that
the Bayesian approach better matches our intuition of uncertainty and provides
answers that are more easily interpreted. No approach to statistics
is completely objective. The Bayesian approach makes
our assumptions more explicit. Both Bayesian and
Frequentist approaches are valuable for a whole range of data analysis,
as well as scientific discovery. The Bayesian approach provides better
quantification of uncertainty. If you do want to go farther with Bayesian
statistics, the next topics to explore, would be hierarchical modeling, and the fitting of non conjugate models
with Markov chain Monte Carlo, or MCMC. I hope you've enjoyed this course, and that you've gained an understanding of
the base new approach to statistics, and I hope that you find it
useful in what you do.
