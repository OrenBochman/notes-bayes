In this segment, I will discuss
conditional probability, and Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is the theoretical
underpinning of most of what we do within the Bayesian
statistical framework. Conditional probability is when we're
trying to consider two events that are related to each other. So we can ask, what is the probability of event
A given that we know event B happened? This is defined as the probability
that both events A and B happened divided by the probability
that event B happens. For example,
consider a class of 30 students Suppose within this class,
there are 9 female students. Suppose also,
we have 12 computer science majors. And of which, 4 are female. So then, we can ask questions about
probabilities of the segment population. We can say the probability that
someone's female is 9 in 30 or 3 in 10. The probability of someone,
who is a computer science major is 12 over 30, or 2 in 5. The probability that
someone is both female, and a computer science major,
we have the 4 out of 30. So now we can ask conditional
probability questions. What's the probability that someone
is female given they're a computer science major? So if we think about the definition,
we can work with that. This is the probability that someone
is female, and they're a computer science major divided by the probably
their computer science major. Probability that someone is female,
and computer science is right up here, this is 2 out of 15, and probably their
computer science major is 2 in 5. You can simplify this down, to get this probability is 1 in 3. We can also think about that in the
original framework here of the 12 computer science majors, what fraction are female, that's exactly what this
probability is saying. The probability that they're female
given they're computer science. And so
there we could just look at the 4 over 12, that would give us the same answer of 1/3. It's an intuitive way to think about
a conditional probability is that we're looking at a sub segment
of the original population, and asking a probability
question within that segment. We can also look in the other direction, suppose we want to know what's the
probability that someone's female given they're not a computer science major, or
I might denote that, as CS compliment. In this case,
we can say it's a probability female, and not computer science over
the probability of not computer science, and this is 5 in 30 over 18 in 30,
or 5 over 18. There's a concept of independence, which is when one event
doesn't depend on the other. When two events are independent,
we have that the probability of A given B is equal to just the probability of A, it
doesn't matter whether, or not B occurred. When this is true,
we also get that the probability of A and B happening is just the probability
of A times the probability of B. This is a useful equality that
we'll use throughout this course. In this case, we can see that the probability of being a
female given they're computer scientist is not equal to the marginal
probability that they're female. And so, being female and being
computer science are not independent.
