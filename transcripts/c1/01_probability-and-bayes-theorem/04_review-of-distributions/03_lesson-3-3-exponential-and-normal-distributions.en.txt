Some particular examples of
continuous distributions are next. Let's start with
the exponential distribution. We can write X follows an exponential
distribution with a rate parameter lambda. So, these are events that are occurring
at a particular rate, and the exponential is the waiting
time in between events. For example, you're waiting for a bus. The bus comes once every ten minutes. And then,
the exponential is your waiting time. This is particularly true for
events coming from a Poisson process. The density function for x given lambda,
is lambda times e to the minus lambda x. This is for none negative values of x. The expected value is one over lambda and
the variance is 1 over lambda squared. So in the case of a bus that comes once
every ten minutes, the rate is one-tenth. Another example is
the uniform distribution. We saw this already in the case
where it's uniform on 0, 1. But it could be on a larger interval,
in fact, the end points could be unknown. It could be uniform between
end points theta 1 and theta 2. This case, we write its density. x|theta 1, theta 2 = 1/theta 2- theta 1 times the indicator function that
x is between theta 1 and theta 2. Final example I want to mention right now
is the Normal Distribution, also known as the Gaussian Distribution. We say that X ~ N ( M, O2 ) In this case, it's density function is
1 over the square root of 2 pi sigma squared times e to the minus 1 over 2 sigma squared x minus mu squared. This says mean mu, and
variance signal squared. In the supplemental material, are some
additional, important distributions, such as the gamma distribution,
and the beta distribution.
