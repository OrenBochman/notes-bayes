When we use a uniform prior for
a Bernoulli likelihood, we get a beta posterior. Likelihood of y given theta, the sum
of theta to the sum of the y sub i, 1 minus theta to the n
minus sum of the y sub is. Our prior for theta is just a uniform. And thus our posterior for theta, Is the likelihood times
the prior Over the integral of the likelihood times the prior D theta,
so that it integrates up to 1. So, the likelihood again, is theta theta
to the sum of y sub is, 1 minus theta, N minus the sum of the y sub is,
times the indicator function for the prior And then the denominator,
just make sure this integrates up to 1. Rather than try to work out this integral, we use the common trick of recognizing
it as the kernel of a beta distribution. And so we rearrange the terms in here to
make it be exactly a beta distribution so that this interval will be one and
it will go away. Beta distributions have these
gamma functions in them. And so here's what we're going to need
to put in to make this all work out correctly. Until this integral now
is going to be gamma of n plus 2 over gamma of sum of the ys plus1. Times gamma and minus the y sub is plus 1,
times theta to the y sub is, 1 minus theta, and
one minus the y sub is g theta. What we have here now is a data distribution, and
so it integrates up into 1. And thus this whole expression
simplifies to gamma, n plus 2 over gamma sum
of the y sub is plus 1, times gamma n minus the sum
of the y sub is plus 1, times theta to the sum of the y sub is,
1 minus theta to n minus the sum of the y sub is times indicator
function that theta's between 0 and 1. Thus we see the posterior for
theta given y follows a beta distribution with parameters
sum of the y sub i plus 1, and n minus some of the y sub is plus one.
