This segment will look at a binomial
beta conjugate analysis using Excel and looking at using Excel for
questions about distributions. Up at the top of this file,
I post the scenario and some questions Suppose we
were giving two students a multiple choice exam with 40 questions
where each question has four choices. We don't know how much students
have studied for this exam, but we think that they will do better
than just guessing randomly. Based on the scenario we can
ask a number of questions. What are the parameters of interest? What is our likelihood? What prior should we use? What is the prior probability that
data parameter would be greater than one-quarter, one-half or 0.08? Suppose the first student get
33 of 40 questions right. If they have parameter theta one,
what's the posterior distribution for this parameter? It's a posterior probability that it's
greater than one quarter, one half, or 0.8 and
what's 95% credible interval for it. Suppose the second student
gets only 24 questions right, what's the posterior distribution for
their parameter? What's the posterior probability
it's greater than 0.25 0.5 or 0.8? And what's the 95% posterior
credible interval for it? And finally, what's supposed to be your
probability that theta 1 is greater than theta 2, that is, that the first student
has a better chance of getting a question right than the second student. First two questions are more
theoretical questions. Our parameters of interest are theta 1
being the true probability the first student will answer
the question correctly. And theta two being the true probability
the second student will answer the question correctly. We're going to use a binomial likelihood
with parameters n equals 40 and probability given by
the appropriate theta. Here, we're assuming that
each question is independent. And that the probability a student gets
each question right is the same for all questions for that student. Now, how do we decide
what prior we should use? For a binomial likelihood,
the conjugate prior is a beta prior. Let's explore some possible beta priors. I'm going to setup some columns
here in the spreadsheet. So then we can look at plots
of possible beta priors. So in column B, I'm going to
have possible values for theta. We'll look at the prior
distribution f of theta. We'll be looking at the likelihood for
theta1. The posterior for theta1. The likelihood for theta2. And the posterior for theta2. For theta we're going to have
values going from 0.01 up to 0.99. We can use the fill function. Edit, Fill,
Series to go down the column in increments of 0.01 going up to a value of 0.99. I'm going to set this up so that we've
got some flexibility in the formula. And the two parameter that should
obey the distribution are often called alpha and beta. And let's start with the standard
uniform distribution, the default prior so that's values one and
one in our prior beta distribution. Prior density we can stick into column C. There isn't a built in function in
Excel for beta density so we'll write this out by hand using the factorial
function to get the gamma functions. We'll paste this in to the first cell and
then we'll copy it to the remaining cells. We can now plot this using a line plot. This is a uniform distribution. All probabilities between 0 and
1 are equally likely. The standard default distribution for
a prior but it doesn't encode our
information in this case, that we think that they will do
better than just guessing randomly. So we need a prior that will
put its mass above 0.25. For example, we might think that our
prior probability should be two-thirds. So let's consider some possibilities for
priors, with prior being two-thirds. One example would be an alpha of four and
a beta of two. So now,
because I've set it up as a formula, Excel automatically updates it and
updates the plot. You can see here the mass has
moved to higher probabilities. But at 0.25 there's still a fair amount
of probability that's below 0.25. So, the larger we make
these parameter values, the more concentrated
the distribution gets. Let's try something a little more
concentrated, for example, 8 and 4. This is now looking good, because at 0.25
there is very little probability that this distribution is below 0.25 and it's
fairly nicely spread between 0.25 and 1. So for the rest of this piece
we'll use a prior distribution, that's the beta, with parameters 8 and 4. Let's find the probabilities that
the prior distribution will be above 0.25, 0.5 or 0.8. We can use the beta disk function, this is the cumulative distribution
function for beta distribution. We call it cumulative distributions to
probability the distribution is less or equal to that value so if we want to
greater than we'll take one minus. So the prior probability that
a theta will be greater than one-quarter is 0.9988, almost 1. Probability that it's
greater than a half is 0.887. And the probability that it's
greater than 0.8 is 0.16. Now suppose the first student takes the
exam and gets 33 of 40 questions right. Posterior distribution will be a beta
distribution of parameters 8 plus 33, and 4 plus 40 minus 33, or 41 and 11. We can think about what are the posterior
mean and maximum likely estimates. Posterior mean for theta 1 is 0.788
the maximum likely estimate is 0.825. Recall the prior mean is two-thirds and so
you can see that the posterior mean is in between the prior mean and the data
estimate or maximum likelihood estimate. Let's go ahead and
plot the likelihood and the posterior. The likelihood we can get
the binomial distribution. And in Excel, we can get the density
by setting the cumulative equals false. The posterior density is
another beta distribution, and that one we'll need to calculate by hand. I'll take these two values,
copy them down into the rest of the chart. So now I can plot the likelihood. And plot the posterior. I'm putting them on different charts
because they're on different scales and so they don't show up well
all on the same chart. But we can line them up nicely here and
see that in fact, the posterior Is close to the likelihood, and
in between the likelihood and the prior. The posterior's closer in shape and location to the likelihood, because
the likelihood has more information in it. Recall here we have 40 data
points in the likelihood, and the prior has an effective
sample size of 8 plus 4 or 12. So there's more information in the
likelihood than there is in the prior and thus the posterior looks more like the
likelihood than it looks like the prior but is somewhere in between. Posterior probabilities that theta one
is greater than quarter half of 0.8 Those are essentially 1.99999 and 0.4444. You can see that masses accumulated up here between 0.6 and 0.9 are so. And so, we're almost certain that
theta 1 is greater than half. And there's a reasonable
chance it's greater than 0.8, which is a big change from the prior. We can look at equal tailed
95% credible interval. Using the beta inverse function and
we can see that there's a 95% posterior probability that the true value of
theta 1 is in between 0.669 and 0.887. And that makes sense
relative to this plot. Now let's consider second student. Second student got only
24 of 40 questions right. And so their posterior distribution will
be a beta with parameters 32 and 20. We can look at the posterior mean and
max likelihood estimate for theta2. Recall the prior mean is two-thirds. The posterior mean is point 0.615. The maximum likely to
estimate is point 0.6. So again, here they are closer,
but the posterior mean is in between the likelihood for
beta estimate and the prior estimate We can put the likelihood for
theta 2 into column F here. And put the posterior for
theta 2 in column G. Now take these, and
we'll paste it down in spreadsheet, and we'll make plots of them as well. The likelihood for theta 2. And the posterior for theta 2. So in this case, the posterior is a little
bit lower than it was for theta 1, which makes sense because the second student
didn't get as many questions right. Again it's much closer to the likelihood
than it is to the prior but the posterior is in between. And you can see that it's going
roughly from about 0.45 to 0.8. So we can again ask questions, what are the posterior probabilities that
theta 2 is greater than one-quarter, one-half or 0.8 as well as what's
a 95% credible interval for theta 2? We can see, posterior probably is
greater than a quarter Is essentially 1, there is a 95% probability that
it's greater than half but the probability that theta 2 is greater
than 0.8 is very small, 0.00125. That make sense from the picture. Theta 2 is not likely to
be as large as theta 1. 95% credible interval
goes from 0.48 to 0.74. It is worth noting the credible interval
does overlap with the credible interval for theta 1. So what is the posterior probability
that theta 1 is greater than theta 2? Well we can do this by drawing
random samples from each of them and see how often we observe
theta 1 greater than theta 2. So let's put theta 1 in column H and
theta 2 in column I and we'll draw some random samples here. Oops. When we draw samples using the inverse
CDF method for drawing random values. So when draw random uniform put it
into the beta inverse function and that will give me a draw
from the beta distribution. For theta 2, same idea except
with different data parameters. And finally I'm going to ask Is
theta one larger than theta two. So I'm going to set up
an indicator function for theta one larger than theta two and
put that into column J. Now we can take this and copy this formula
down and fill up 500 rows of this. And we'll use that to
estimate by simulation, so this is a Monte Carlo experiment, and
we'll just estimate using the empirical probability that theta one
is greater than theta two. So we'll get 500 samples, and for the
indicator function we'll add up all 500 of them divided by 500 and that will give us
an empirical estimate of the probability that theta one is bigger than theta two. So here we have 500 theta 1 values,
500 theta 2 values, and then our indicator functions and you can see in almost all
cases, theta 1 is greater than theta 2. There are some cases where theta
one is less than theta two. So this number's probably going to be
close to one, but it won't be exactly one. So we'll scroll down. Stick in a sum. Divide that by 500. And see we get an empirical
estimate of 0.98. So we can say that we think the posterior
probability theta 1 is greater than theta 2 is approximately 0.98. And some of the exercises later in this
course, you'll be ask to work with other distributions besides
the binomial and the beta. And so in Excel there are functions for
gamma distributions and for normal distributions as well.
