Let's take a look at a more general case. Continuous version of Bayes theorem
is that f of theta given y is equal to f of y given theta times
f of theta over f of y. Or we can write that of f of y
given theta times f of theta or with the interval of f of y given
theta times f of theta d theta. We can see that this is the likelihood. Times the prior,
divided by a normalizing constant. Likelihood times the prior and then this
is just a constant that will make sure that this integrates to one, because we
need this at the end of the day to be a proper probability density function. And it's clear that this will integrate to
one because we're dividing by exactly what it is on top. In practice, sometimes this
integral can be a pain to compute. And so, we may work with looking
at saying this is proportional to The likelihood times the prior. And if we can figure out
what this looks like and just put the appropriate
normalizing constant on at the end, we don't necessarily have
to compute this integral. So for example,
suppose we're looking at a coin and it has unknown probability
theta of coming up heads. Suppose we express ignorance about the
value of theta by assigning it a uniform distribution. So we can write f of theta is just the
indicator function that theta is between zero and one. Now we flip the coin and we get one head. We want to say,
having observed one flip of the coin, what's our posterior probability
distribution for theta? So f of theta, given y,
is this expression here. In practice, try to compute this in
more general form, we can do it but it will be a little bit more work. Let's go ahead and plug in f of theta
given we observed ahead, given y = 1. So this will be theta to the 1, 1 minus
theta to the 0, times the indicator function that theta is between 0 and 1,
divided by the integral of all of this. D theta. So this simplifies on top to theta
times the indicator function. And the bottom, this will be the integral
now from 0 to 1 of theta d theta. The integral of theta d theta is
going to be one half theta squared. We evaluate that on 0,
1 and we just get one-half. So this whole thing simplifies to 2
theta times the indicator function that theta's between 0 and 1. As a side note,
we could do this whole thing in terms of proportionality f(theta
given y) is proportional to f(y given theta) times f(theta). And so, we can say that's proportional
to theta times the indicator function that theta is between 0 and 1. And then, we just need to normalize
this so that it will integrate to one. And as we saw earlier,
then taking the integral of this, the correct normalizing constant is
that we just stick a two on this. So this is the same type of approach,
we get to the same answer. We stick the normalizing
constant on at the end, if we can recognize what
this is at the end. In some cases later,
this will turn out much easier to just use the proportionality approach rather
than a full equality approach and trying to work out the integral.
