Now let's take a look at
the Bayesian approach. An advantage of the Bayesian approach is
that it allows you to easily incorporate prior information, when you know something
in advance of the looking at the data. This is difficult to do under
the Frequentist paradigm. In this case,
we're talking about your brother. You probably know him pretty well. Because you've been around him a bunch,
and this isn't the first time
he's come to you with a coin, you may have some information on this that
you want to incorporate into the problem. So suppose you think that before
you've looked at the coin, there's a 60% probability
that this is the loaded coin. This case, we put this into our prior, our
prior is that the probability the coin is loaded is.0.6. We can now update our prior with
the data to get our posterior beliefs, and we do this using base theorem. F of theta given x, is going to be f
of x given theta, times f of theta, over all possibilities for
theta of f of x given theta, f of theta. In this case, the only two possibilities
for theta are that it's fair or loaded. So this likelihood is the same
as what we saw before, but this time we'll be adding in the prior. One half to the fifth, times the prior
probability that the coin is fair. Plus 0.7 to the x, 0.3 to the 5- x,
times the prior probability it's loaded. If we plug in our observed data,
x equals 2, this will work out to be 0.0125 that it equals fair, plus 0.0079. Theta equals loaded over 0.0125 plus 0.0079. Simplifying this, we get 0.612 theta equals fair, plus 0.388 Theta equals loaded. As you can see in the calculation here,
we have the likelihood times the prior in the numerator, and in the denominator,
we have a normalizing constant, so that when we divide by this,
we'll get answers that add up to one. These numbers match exactly in this case,
because it's a very simple problem. But this is the concept that goes on,
what's in the denominator here is always a normalizing constant, so that in
the end of the day, we get probabilities. And so
we can say at the end of the day here, the probability theta equals loaded,
given x equals 2. So our posterior probability that this is
the loaded coin works out to be 0.388. Isn't that a much more satisfying answer,
under the Bayesian approach, where we get a probability, and
we can interpret this probability. We can say, what is the probability
that we think this coin is loaded after we've observed some data? This is a much more intuitive answer than
we get under the Frequentist paradigm. We can also examine what would happen
under different choices of prior. We did this calculation with
the prior probability of 0.6 for the coin being loaded, but
we might have a different idea, we want to use a different probability. We can use anything between zero and one. Or maybe somebody else is coming in
with a different perspective, and they want to see what their answer is,
using a different prior. One possibility is that we could say
the probability of the coin is loaded, and prior is one half. This might represent an attempt to say,
we're not sure what's going on, it's equally likely that
it's the loaded coin or the fair coin, not that these
are necessarily equally likely outcomes. Taking a prior probability of one half,
we can put it through Bayesian machinery, and that will lead us to get
a posterior probability, theta equals loaded,
given we observe two data points. That works out to be 0.297. We might have a different idea. We might think, because this is
our brother and we know him well, that the prior probability it's
going to be the loaded coin is 0.9. He really likes to use the loaded coin. If this is the case,
then when we go through the calculations, we'll get a posterior probability
that this is a loaded coin of 0.792. In this case, the Bayesian
approach is inherently subjective. It represents your own
personal perspective, and this is an important
part of the paradigm. If you have a different perspective,
you will get different answers, and that's okay. It's all done in a mathematically
vigorous framework, and it's all mathematically consistent and
coherent. In the end,
we get results that are interpretable. It makes sense, we want to ask, what is the probability the coin is
loaded after we've looked at some data, incorporating our beliefs about our
past experiences with our brother? This way we get intuitive answers, we can
say the probability it's loaded is 0.3, or the probability it's loaded is 0.8. Under the Frequentist paradigm,
we can't get a good answer for what is the probability
the coin is loaded. The machinery just is not set up that way. It's not possible to get
a good confidence interval. What would it even mean to have
a confidence interval for, is the coin loaded? The Frequentist approach has
a number of buried assumptions. We need to make a choice, which is inherently subjective about
what is our reference population? About what is our likelihood? These are assumptions that
are inherently subjective, that are buried deeper into
the Frequentist paradigm, and so there's an attempt to pretend
that everything is objective. Under the Bayesian paradigm, we're
explicit that this is a subjective and personal approach. But we can also be explicit about
what all of our assumptions are, and then see how our answers
depend on our assumptions.
