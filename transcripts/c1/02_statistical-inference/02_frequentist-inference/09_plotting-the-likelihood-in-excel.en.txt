In the video lecture, we talk about
a hospital with 400 heart attack patients of whom 72 die within 30 days and
328 are still alive. Let's plot the likelihood function for
this example. The likelihood is a function
of the mortality rate data. We could use either a binomial
likelihood or a Bernoulli likelihood. They are the same other than
a constant term in the front, the combinatoric term for the binomial
that does not depend on theta. So we'll get the same answer either way,
and it's easier to use
the Bernoulli likelihood. We can plot this in Excel. We'll need to create a column of theta
values and a column of likelihood values. For the theta values,
we'll want it to go from 0.01, up to 0.99, in increments of 0.01. We can create this column,
by using the Fill command. Edit > Fill > Series. We want to put the series in a column. We'll grow linearly,
have a step value of 0.01, and go all the way up to the value of 0.99. So now, Excel has filled it in,
from 0.01 up to 0.99. For the likelihood,
we'll create a function. So we start with the equal
sign to create a function. And cis theta to the y times 1
minus theta to the n minus y. The value of theta we're going to plug
in is the value in the adjacent column. We take this to the y power,
in this case y is 72. We'll multiply this by 1 minus theta. To the n minus y,
where n is 400 and y is 72. We have this formula now defined for
the first row. What we can do is we can
copy this formula and then paste it in to all
the remaining cells. Excel has now filled in the likelihood
values for us and recomputed them for each of the possible theta values. In order to make a plot of this,
we'll use a chart. So I'll highlight the column
with the likelihood values. Go to Charts, choose a line chart,
and do a basic line chart. If you look carefully,
you'll be able to see that the likelihood function is maximized at 0.18 or
72 over 400. This is the maximum likelihood estimate. You could also do the same
with the log likelihood. This formula is going to be y times the
log of theta plus n minus y times the log of 1 minus theta. So we can enter this as
a formula in Excel that equals y is 72 times the log of
theta value from this row. Plus. N minus y times the log of
1 minus the theta value. Again, we can copy that
into the remaining cells. Paste. We highlight this column and create
a line chart for the log likelihood. It's a little bit harder to see, but the
log likelihood is also maximized at 0.18.
