[MUSIC] Let's conclude the derivation
of the MCMC algorithm by finding the full posterior distribution for
the mu sub ks. And the calculation is going to
be the same for mu1 and mu2, so I'm just going to do it for
a generic value of k. As I said before it's going to be useful
to define n sub k as just a number of observations in the kth components. So the sum from pi = 1 to n of the indicators that c sub i = k. And the other quantity that
is going to be helpful to define as we did before,
is x bar sub k. That is just the average of
the observations in that Kth component. So this is the sum over the i's, such that c sub i = k of x sub i. So the number of observations
in the kth component, and the average of the observations
in the kth component, okay. So if I'm trying to derive
the full posterior for mu sub k, given the rest of parameters,
what I'm going to need from here is. Just the terms that correspond to
the observations in the kth component out of here. And of course, the prior that is
associated with the kth component coming from the prior, I can ignore all
the other terms in there posterior. So this is going to be
proportional to first of all this product over
the i such that c of i equal to k of 1 over
the square root two pi sigma, exp- 1/2 sigma square xi- mu sub k squared. And then I'm going to have exp if I want- 12 tau squared mu sub k- eta squared. Remember that this is proportional to, so I can ignore the 1 over
square root 2 pi tau. Just as I, by the way, could have
dropped this already, if I want. So further simplifying this,
this quantity's going to be proportional to exp, and
now the product goes inside the sum. So I have -1/2 sigma square sum over the i's such that c sub i = k of xi- mu k squared, multiplied by exp of -1/2 tau square mu sub k- eta squared. And if you look at these
quantities carefully, you will see that this is just
a plot of a normal kernel. So inside off here,
if I expand the squares, I'm going to get a quadratic
form on mu sub k. And then I have another normal
kernel again, if I expand the score, I'm going to get a quadratic form. So if we're careful doing
the completion of squares good, we're going to get his normal kernel
as our posterior distributions. So I'm going to proceed to do
that calculation carefully now. We just derived from
our full posterior for mu sub k, and it is still proportional to the exponent of -1/2 sigma square sum over the i such that c sub i is equal to k of x sub i minus mu sub k square. Multiplied by the term that comes from the prior exp of -1/2 tau square mu sub k minus eta squared. So, to really show that this is going to
take the form of a normal distribution, we need to do the expansion
of the squares. So I'm going to work with
what's inside the exponential. So I can rewrite this as exp(-1/2), 1 over sigma square sum, Of xi- mu sub k is squared. This goes outside, + 1 one over tau square meters sub k minus eta square. So I'm going to work with this expression
with these two terms outside and then I'm going to just plug it back. So as a side, I'm going to have 1 over sigma square sum of xi- mu sub k is square and sum i such that ci = k, + 1 over tau square (mu sub k- eta) square. Is going to be equal to, so expanding the squares, I'm going to have 1 over sigma square, sum over the i's such that ci = k of xi square -2 times mu sub k times the sum over the i's such that ci = k of xi + mu sub k squared. Again, summed over the indicators, but I have n terms in this sum, and
they all correspond to mu k square. So I can just substitute
the quantity n sub k, that I had defined before, in there. And I have the terms
that come this expansion, so I'm going to have a 1 over tau square, mu usb k square- 2 mu
sub k eta + eta squared. So now,
trying to pull similar terms together, we're going to have n
sub k over sigma square times mu sub k square,
that's this term right here. + the next term, it's going to
be the one that comes from here, there is 1 over tau square
multiplied by new k squared. - 2 times, I'm going to go now with
the terms that are linear in music k, so I'm going to have 2 times mu sub k. Now, if you look carefully what this is, this is the sum of observations
that are in the kth component. The sum of observations
in the case component can be represented as n sub
k multiplied by x power k. Remember, this is the average of
the observations, when you multiply by the number of observations, it just
gives you the sum that we started with. So this term here,
the next term is going to be this one. So -2 times mu sub k times eta, and then finally we have the two
additional terms, and excuse me we are missing of course,
sigma square in here from this product,
and a tau square in here, from this product,
very important to remember. And finally, we have a term that is 1 over sigma squared, sum, i's c sub i = k of xi square + eta square over tau square. And just combining them together we are going to look at this
as an n sub k divided by sigma square + 1 over tau square that multiplies mu sub k
square- 2 times mu sub k. That multiplies n sub k, x bar sub k divided by sigma square + eta divided by tau squared + the leftover terms, 1 over sigma squared sum over the i's, such that c sub i = k of xi square + n square, over tau square. So now that we have written the expression
in this form, it's clear that the term inside the exponential here just
correspond to a quadratic form on mu. And we can do a completion of
squares to find the expression for the full conditional of mu sub k. Using the side derivation
that we just did, we can rewrite now this expression as
being equal to the exponential of -1/2 and then all the terms into which
we simplify this expression. So we're going to have n sub
k divided by sigma square + 1 over tau square multiplied
by mu sub k square. We're going to have -2 times
mu sub k that multiplies n sub k x bar sub k divided by sigma
square + eta divided tau square, and then we are going to
have the extra terms. The 1 over sigma square sum over the i's such that c sub i = k of xi square + eta square divided by tau squared. Now as you can see, this expression here
doesn't really depend on mu sub k anyway, so I could break this into two terms, two
exponential terms and multiply each other. And because the one that involves
these terms doesn't have mu sub k, it can be dropped out
of the proportionality. So I can just write this in turn, as being
proportional to the exponential of -1/2, n sub k divided by sigma
squared + 1 over tau square, mu sub k square- 2 times mu sub k, n sub k x bar sub k over sigma square + eta over tau square. So I just discard these additional terms. And finally to get the structure of
the kernel to look like that have a normal distribution, I just need to carry
out completion of the squares. Which is one that you should
already be familiar with. And again, there is going to be an extra
term that doesn't depend on mu coming out of the competition of scores. And that extra term can be dropped out
just in the same way that we dropped these two terms out there. If you do that calculation
carefully on your own, you will find that what you get is
this is in turn proportional to- 1/, n sub k over sigma plus 1 over tau square. That multiplies mu sub k Two terms in the numerator,
n sub k, x bar sub k, divided by sigma squared +
eta divided by tau squared. And in the denominator, n sub k over sigma square + 1 over tau square. And if you look at this carefully,
you will see that this looks like the kernel of a normal distribution,
where this term here is you can call it eta star if you will,
that it's the updated mean. And you can see this term as being
the precision of the updated precision, so this term is essentially 1 over
tau square star, if you wish. So in other words,
my posterior distribution for mu sub k, given all the parameters, it's going to be a normal
with updated parameters either a star and
variance tau star squared. And this is your traditional
normal normal calculation that you have probably done
many times in the past. Where you can see that the variance of
the posterior is just the harmonic mean of the variance in the prior and in some
sense the variance in the livelihood. And where the posterior mean, it is going to be a way that average
of the meaning the prior that is eta, and the mean in the data that you
can think of as being x bar sub k. [MUSIC]
