Hi, my name is Abel Rodriguez. And I am a Professor of Statistics at
the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Welcome to my course on mixture models. In this course, I will introduce you to
an important class of statistical models. Mixture models provide a flexible
approach to modeling data and are useful in a number of
applications from density estimation, clustering and classification problems. This is because of a couple of reasons. So one of them is that a standard
families of probability distributions such as
the Gaussian the exponential or the Poisson that you may be familiar
with are often too restrictive for modeling features that appear in real data
such as multi-modality or zero inflation. Mixture models, which can be related to Kernel
density estimation procedures address. This issues in a way that allows for natural generalizations of
other well-known procedures. But it's not only because of its
application in density estimation. It's also true that in
addition to providing flexible probability distributions finite mixture
models have a very strong relationship with some classical procedures for
clustering and classification. Such as k-mean clustering, linear discriminant analysis in
quadratic discriminant analysis. More generally, mixture models
provide a tool to understand and generalize this approaches as well as
to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimates and
predictions generated by them. To succeed in this course, you should be familiar with the basics
of calculus based probability, the principles of maximum likelihood
estimation and Bayesian estimation. And this includes common computational
tools such as expectation maximization and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm,
particularly Gibbs sampling and random walk Metropolis-Hastings methods. If you feel that you need to strengthen
your background in this area, so I recommend that you consider taking
before this one other Coursera courses such as Bayesian Statistics: From Concepts
to Data by Herbert Lee. And Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and
Models by Matthew Heiner. You will also need some basic
knowledge of the R language. There are a number of coding
assignments in this course, if you need to strengthen your knowledge
of R, I recommend The Course R Programming by Roger Peng and co-authors, and
this is also available in Coursera. Now, let me tell you a little bit
about how the course is structured. So there are five modules, we start with
basic concepts, then we move on to maximum likelihood estimation for mixture models,
then we consider Bayesian estimation, then we consider kind of traditional
applications of mixture models. And then we move onto some advanced
topics related to for example selecting the number of components in the mixture
component and related topics. Each module has lecture videos with
video questions to help you check your understanding. It has short quizzes, useful readings, and peer review assignments that will allow
you to apply what you have learned and to see how your fellow learners
have approach the material. There are also regular discussions that
I encourage you to participate in. I wish you the best of
luck in this course, Bayesian statistical measure models.
