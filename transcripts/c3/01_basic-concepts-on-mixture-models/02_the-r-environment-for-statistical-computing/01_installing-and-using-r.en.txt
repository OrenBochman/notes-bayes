An important part of
this course is how to implement the models that
we will be discussing. We do that using the R Environment which
is an environment for scientific computing
that has become the standard posts in academia
in many areas of industry. To download R you can go to the R project website
which you can see here. Once you login to the website, you will see a lot of links
on the left hand side. Go into the download link CRAN. That will take you to a list of servers that contain
copies of the environment, because we are located in the US, I'm going to use
US located mirror. For example, I'm going to use
the mirror at UC Berkeley. They all look the same, they all take you to a website
that looks like this. Because we are working
with a Mac environment, I'm going to go into
download R for (Mac) OS X, and I'm going to download the binary files which
are already compiled and ready to be installed by
clicking in the current version. At the time that we're
recording these lectures the most current version
of R is 3.4.3. There is annual releases
of new versions, and there are in addition to
the annual major release, there are a few additional
releases across the year. So I strongly recommend
that you keep your version of R up to date. In addition to using R
for the computation, we will use a graphic
user interface a GUI, that was developed by RStudio. This is a very powerful
graphical interface. It provides a lot of additional functionalities
and it just simplifies the use of R. You can download that interface from this website
www.rstudio.com. If you go into download RStudio, you can download a free version
of the software, and you can download
it according to what's the operating system that
you use in your computer, in our case we're working
with a Mac environment. So we're going to download
the Mac OS version of it, and again once you have in
your computer it's very simple to install it just like you would install
any other software. Once you have installed RStudio, it will typically be located
in your menu bar down here. You can just click
on it and it will open a terminal that
looks like this. What you have on
the left hand side is your standard R console
where you can input any command
that you need to execute in R. On the top, you have a list of the variables that are
currently in your environment. As you can see since
we haven't done anything with R yet
the environment is empty, but as you start creating
objects using the console, you will start to see
different objects appear here. On the bottom right corner
of the screen, you have multiple tabs that you can cycle through that
have different functions. The file stack is
used to just browse the contents of your computer
just like you would do with the regular browser. It also allows you to
for example set what is the current working
directory from which R will read and write
anything to the system. You also have a plots windows. Any plot that you
generate from within the console will appear
here in this plots window. Finally you have a list of the packages that are currently
loaded in the system. You can load and unload
packages from here. You have help window also where any help that you search using the help command from
the console will appear here, and you can easily toggle through the different
options just by clicking in the taps on
the top of the window. If you want to
learn more about R, there is a number
of Coursera courses that can help you learn
more about the environment.
