In this code, we will see how to compute the characteristic roots of the AR polynomial given a particular set
of AR coefficients. I'm just going to work here with an example in which we have the AR coefficients of an AR(8). This is just setting some
values for these coefficients, the first line here is just
keeping these in a vector. Based on these coefficients
for these AR(8), we're going to
compute the roots of the characteristic
polynomial and the reciprocal roots in this case of the
characteristic polynomial, so we're going to use the
function polyroot to do that. Because we want the reciprocals, is going to be one over the roots of the
characteristic polynomial. For the polyroots function, you just enter the AR
coefficients here, remember you have the AR
characteristic polynomial, the first coefficient is one, and then you have
the negative values of the AR coefficients. Just doing that, if we now want to compute the moduli
of the reciprocal roots, we can use a function Mod in R. If we want to compute the periods of
the reciprocal roots, we are going to use
a function Arg, these gives me the arguments, but if I compute two times Pi over the argument
of the reciprocal roots, I get the periods. We can now bring the
results in terms of modulus and frequency, and we're printing them
by decreasing order. If you look at the
results down here, you're going to have an AR. Again, an AR(8) for this particular set
of AR coefficients, we are going to have
exactly four pairs of complex reciprocal roots. This here, the first line corresponds to the modulus and the period of
the first root, so it's a very persistent
modulus of 0.97. Then we have a period
that is around 12.7. Then the rest of the roots
are also complex valued, they are in decreasing moduli, so we can see that the
second one has modulus around 0.81 With
period around five, the third one 0.72 with
period around three, and then the last 0.66
with period around 2.23. If you remember, is
going to matter in terms of the contribution
to both, the autocorrelation function and to the forecast function
of this process. Now, I'm just going to show you what we can do in terms of simulating from
different AR processes of orders two and three, and then looking at the
properties of those processes. Here, the first example
I'm considering is an AR(2) that happens to have one pair of complex
valued reciprocal roots the modulus 0.95 and
the period is 12, so we just keep those, we transform to the
Phi coefficients using the equations
we have described, and then we get the
AR coefficients. Now that we have
the AR coefficients and this is my AR coefficient, the one corresponding to
the first lag is about 1.65 and minus 0.902
for the second lag. We can now generate data from an AR(2) use the
function arima.sim. I'm setting the random
seed first and then I'm going to select here the number of data points
that I want to simulate, in this case is going
to be 300 data points. The variance of the process at the observational level here, so it's just the innovations
standard deviation and variance is one, then I'm going to use the
function and I'm going to say that I'm going to keep my data here in the yt object and I'm going to use the function arima.sim
so it is 300 observations. The model here is a pure
auto-regressive model. The first component here corresponds to the
AR coefficients, so I just pass these
as a vector containing the AR coefficients for this AR(2) and then I specify the standard
deviation as well. Once I do that, I can
plot my simulated data is here and we can
see that it has these quasi periodic behavior. The quasi periodic behavior
is consistent with these. Reciprocal roots are
complex valued with period 12 and a
persistent modulus. Then if we look at properties of this
process in terms of the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation
function, we can plot them both, and if we zoom in here, just the first function that we're plotting
here is the sample ACF, and we can see again, I'm just plotting the first
50 lags of the sample ACF. We have that behavior that we expect for
this type of process is process has a pair of complex valued roots
with period 12. We can see these quasi-periodicity
appears in the ACF, and then there is a decay in the ACF coefficients in the sample ACF coefficients
as the lag increases, which is consistent
with the fact that the root has a modulus, that is, the reciprocal root has a modulus that is below one. If we think about
the partial ACF, remember for an autoregressive
process of order p, the partial ACF,
these are the sampled. Partial ACFs are going to be zero after the
lag of the process. This is the theoretical
property here for the sample. We can see that this
is also the case. The first two coefficients are significant and
then the other ones are within the confidence bands provided by the R function. This is for this
particular example. I'm now going to
simulate an AR(2) with two real reciprocal roots rather than having one
pair of complex valued, reciprocal roots, we have
two real reciprocal roots, one with modulus 0.95 and
another one with modulus 0.5. If we do the same here, we have the Phi coefficients, so we just transform the reciprocal roots to
the AR coefficients. These are now my two AR
coefficients and I'm going to just do something similar
to what I did before. I'm going to sample
300 data points using arima.sim function. The standard deviation of the innovation
continues to be one. I just changed the
AR coefficients. This is my yt, we can plot the
simulated observations and we can see that the
process is different. The data set is different
to what we had before, so it shows different
characteristics. There is no
quasiperiodic behavior that is apparent in
this particular plot. There is this behavior
that is almost similar, a little bit like a random
walk type of behavior, which is consistent with
the fact that we have, two real reciprocal roots and one of them is
very persistent, is the modulus is 0.95. When we look at the ACF
and the PACF of this data, so this is again the sample
ACF and the sample PACF, just zooming in here. We can see that for
the sample ACF, we again have this decay
as the lag decreases, we don't have any
quasiperiodic behavior here. This is a process that is
just decaying over time. Then for the sample PACF, we have the first
two coefficients that are significantly
different from zero, and then the remaining
coefficients are mostly within the
confidence bands. This is again consistent with what the characteristics of the process that
we were expecting. The next example is an AR(3). Here, I'm going to simulate from an autoregressive
process of order 3. There are different alternatives that we can have in terms of the complex or real
reciprocal roots. In this case, I'm going
to assume that we have one pair of complex valued reciprocal roots and one
real reciprocal root, the complex valued
reciprocal root, I'm going to assume that
that pair has modulus 0.95. Again, it's fairly persistent
and that period of 12, so in that sense is similar
to the behavior that we had before when we
considered the AR(2) with this particular
root structure. But now, in addition to that, we are going to have
another root that has modulus 0.8 and
that one is real valued. Again, we use this function
to obtain the Phis. If you look at the Phi
coefficients here now, we have three
coefficients: Phi[1], Phi[2], and Phi[3]. They go with the past
three values of the yts. We are going to
once again sample 300 data points using the arima.sim
function to do that. We have the same
standard deviation as before and we can
plot the process. You can see here that
this process has very many characteristics
that are similar to what we observe with the first
example with the AR(2). It has that same roots structure for the complex valued root. But in addition to that, we also have a real
valued reciprocal root. If we look at the ACF, the sample ACF and
the sample PACF, we can see now, again, the behavior is similar
to what we had before. The only difference here
is that we are going to have more structure. Here, we have that quasiperiodic
behavior that is decaying also as a function of the lag and then for
the partial ACF, we can see that it's indicating that maybe we
have more than one lag, that is more than
the first two lags that are significantly
different from zero. This is the case for an AR(3). Again, the process is
still dominated by the root that has
the highest modulus, which in this case happens to
be the complex valued root. But there is an additional
root here that changes a bit the structure of the
process and it will change, therefore the ACF and the PACF.
