It is good to talk a little bit about what is the
relationship between, again the AR process
in the time domain and what spectral representation in the frequency domain we can get. This is important for
interpretability and it provides a way to just see
what's happening or what kind of properties we have
in the process as well. In the case of an AR(P), you're going to have
your coefficients and your variance v.
If you have an AR(P), those are the AR coefficients. We have talked about
properties related to the autocorrelation
function of the process, and the forecast
function as well. We've seen that
they are related to the reciprocal roots of the
characteristic polynomial. Using this information,
we can also obtain a spectral
representation of the process, meaning a representation
in the frequency domain. Think of this as a density in
the frequency domain where you're going to have a power associated to
different frequencies. In the case of an AR(p), I can write down the spectral
density of the process, calling that f omega here is a frequency
between zero and Pi. You can think of this frequency. Then I can write this down as v, which is the variance
of the process. Then I'm going to have here, let me write it in terms
of the 1 minus Phi 1 e. I have my component here, and then I have a
times 2 Pi over here. If I think about a frequency
between zero and Pi, for example, then I can
plug in a frequency here. You can see that this is essentially the
AR characteristic polynomial evaluated on
e to the minus i omega, which is that representation. Once again, this frequency domain representation
is going to be related to the characteristic
roots of the AR polynomial. For instance, if
you have an AR(2), an autoregressive
process of order 2, and you happen to have a
pair of complex roots. Let's assume that
the reciprocal roots are Alpha 1 and Alpha 2, and then that I have a
modulus which is 0.7. Then a frequency that I'm going to write it
in terms of the period. The periodicity
here, let's say that is the quasi periodicity
in the AR is given by 12. There is again, I can go
back and forth between the complex valued representation and the polar
coordinates and so on. Let's say that I have
that pair of roots with modulus 0.7 and period 12. What I'm going to do is I plug in the
representation in here. For each of these
Alpha 1 and Alpha 2, that correspond to values
of Phi 1 and Phi 2. I can plug those in
here, use the variance, and then plot that as a function of the omega. What happens there is you are going to have something
that looks like this. The peak of that
density is going to be at the frequency that corresponds
to this period of 12. The height that you have, the power in that spectral
density is going to be related to the modulus of
that pair of complex roots. If you increase the modulus, if you now have a
different process with the same quasi-periodicity, but a modulus that is higher. What's going to happen
is that's going to result in a higher peak, in a higher power for
your spectral density. If you have another
process in which you get a larger period or a smaller
period that's going to result in shifts in the
mode of that density. This is a way to represent the process in the
spectral domain.
