We will now talk about how to do a few things
related to time series. In particular, I
will show you how to plot the auto covariance and
the correlation function, the sample autocorrelation
function and the sample
autocovariance function as well as the partial
autocorrelation functions. Here, the first thing I'm
going to do is just going to simulate some data that doesn't have a
temporal structure, just to begin at the very basic so-called
white noise time series. But just to show you a few things related to
time series objects. Here I'm just simulating
some white noise, which means just
200 observations here from a normal
distribution with mean zero, and standard deviation one. I'm going to plot what
I have simulated and then you can see that
if in this case, because these series are
not temporally related, I should not see anything
very structured in the autocorrelation function and in the partial
autocorrelation function. These are the sample
ACF and PACF. There are two functions in R, one is the ACF, the other one is the PACF. Then you can specify
your data here. You can specify the
maximum number of lags you want to
show in the plot. Here I just showed you the 200 samples that I
got from that white noise. If I click on the ACF of that, it's going to show me the
values of the sample ACF for as many lags as I told
the function to plot. In this case, you see that the first value is the
only one that is relevant, is one here because is
just the correlation, the variance divided by itself. You're going to have that and
then you're going to have all the other sample ACFs
for the different lags here. The function shows you a confidence interval
for the values. We see that all the sample
ACF values that we get for this white noise process are negligible as expected
and then for the PACF, you again can specify the
maximum number of lags. Here it starts at lag
1 and then again, all the values here are within
these confidence intervals showing that there is really no temporal structure
in these time series. Another thing that may be
handy when you're working with data that are
temporarily recorded, is just to define the time series data as
a time series object in R. In this case there is a function ts
that allows you to just, if you read your data
from somewhere else, you can specify what
kind of time series object the data is. For example, if I take
the 200 observations, those 200 observations
that I sampled from the normal distribution, they're all identically
distributed, normal 0  1. I can define a time series
that is just saying, well, this is a time series
of monthly observations. I'm going to have
a frequency 12, and I'm going to specify
here that the year that that time series
begins is in January, month 1 of 1960. When I plot the
time series object, I automatically get here the timestamp of each
of the observations. This is monthly data and I'm
representing it like that. I could say that this is; I have yearly data, so I have one
observation per year. In that case, I just specify
that the start is 1960, the frequency is one. I'm going to have one
observation per year. If I were to plot, it's the same data so I'm assuming it has a
different frequency here. You can see that I have 200 years of observations here because I
changed the scale. Then I have another example. You can also have yearly data where you have four
observations per year. If you have quarters there, you can see how the number of years and you just have again
four observations per year. This is just in terms of
defining a time series object, if you want to work with that. We explained that in many cases, we want to do differencing and smoothing by moving
averages just to either get rid of
some components in your time series or you may want to highlight some components
in your time series. I'm going to just do
an example here with some dataset that is available in R. I'm going
to call the data, is the so-called CO2
dataset that shows the atmospheric
concentrations of CO2 in parts per million. These are monthly data
in a particular period, you can find more information
about the data in R, but this is a time series. You can see that
the time series is showing two main features. One is this increasing
trend that says, it's telling you that the
atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are increasing
over time here. The other is a very
marked periodic process. Again, these are monthly data. I'm going to do two things. I'm going to do
something to get rid of the seasonal component in the time series to
highlight the trend. Then we can also try to get rid of the trend by
using differencing. If I were to just
plot the ACF and PACF for these time series
just to see how they look. This here is first the
auto-correlation function. You can see two things. First, it's decaying very slowly, which is consistent with that upward trend that
we see in the data. The other thing you can see here is this quasi-periodicity. Here there is a periodicity in the data that is very marked that we saw
in the data as well. You can see that
periodicity in the ACF. If you plot the PACF, you're going to see also this kind of periodic
type of behavior. You have some partial ACF
values that are large, and then eventually they
decay as the lag goes by. If I wanted to remove
the effects of a given periodic
component with Period 12, I could run the filter
that we described before, and then I can plot now what happens when
I apply these filters. The filter function
in R allows you to specify your filter here. I'm defining these moving
average with these weights, I have one 1/24. Then I have 1/12 for
11 of those weights, and then I have a 1/24. Then the sides, tells
me whether I want to do moving averages on positive
and negative values around the time series. This creates a new time series. If I were to plot
the time series, I get this resulting one. After removing the
seasonal component, I only highlight the
trend in the data. If I were to look at
the ACF and PACF now, again, this is the ACF. After removing that
periodic component, we can see that we still have that slow decay on
the ACF coefficients. But the periodicity
has disappeared, that slow decay is
consistent with that trend that is still
in the smooth data. For the PACF, we see
that essentially we have a very high value for the partial
auto-correlation function at Lag 1 and then everything
else is negligible. If I want to now remove the trend from these
already smoothed by moving average data
I can use differences. I can take the first
difference of the time series, I can take the second
difference of the time series. Let's just do that using
the difference function, by default if you
don't say anything, it's just going to take
the first differences. But you can specify how many
times you want a difference, a particular time series. Here I'm using the
first differences, the second differences. I'm going to plot both
resulting time series. You can see this is what
results after first removing the seasonal component using moving averages and then looking at the
first differences. Then the next is the time series that results after taking differences again. Or just looking at
second differences of the moving average of the time series that
already was removed, had the seasonality removed
by moving averages. Here we can see now that
the trend has disappeared. When we look at the ACF of
the second differences, for example, it looks very different to what we had before. It doesn't have that
very slow decay with lots of coefficients
different from zero. That is characteristic of time
series that have a trend. Same thing with the PACF, it looks different for
the second differences. This is how you can use again both the function diff to look at differences of
a given time series. Then the function filter to just remove components
using moving averages.
