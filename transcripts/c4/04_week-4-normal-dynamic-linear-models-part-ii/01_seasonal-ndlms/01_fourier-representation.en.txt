I will now describe
how to incorporate seasonal components in a
normal dynamic linear model. What we will do is we
will first talk about the so-called single Fourier
component representation. Just in case you have
a single frequency and how to incorporate that single frequency in your
model for the seasonality. Then using the
superposition principle, you can incorporate
several frequencies or a single frequency and the corresponding
harmonics in your model. Let's begin with that. There are other seasonal
representations as well. I will just focus on the Fourier representation
because it allows you to have a lot of flexibility without
having a lot of parameters, in case you want to
consider, for example, a fundamental frequency but you don't want all the harmonics
of that frequency. The Fourier representation, if you happen to have
a single frequency. We will discuss two cases. The case in which the frequency
is between zero and Pi, so this is your Omega frequency, any frequency
between zero and Pi. Then we will
describe the case in which the frequency
is exactly Pi, so the component
representation is different. In the case of any
frequency in this range, you're going to have
dynamic linear model that has this structure. You will have the F vector is going to be a
two-dimensional vector. The first component is one, the second component is zero. This is the usual 1,0 here. Then you're going
to have this G, which I will describe
in a minute, then you have your
corresponding v_t and W_t, wherever you want
to put in here. In the case of the G matrix, that's the matrix
for your model, is going to have this form. It's a two-by-two matrix so
your state parameter vector is also a state parameter
vector of dimension 2. You're going to have the
cosine of the frequency here, the sine of the frequency. That's your G matrix. If you think about the
forecast function, h steps ahead, so you are at time t and you want to look for h steps ahead. If you remember, the
way we work with this is going to be your
E_2 transpose, then you have to
take this G matrix, which is just this J_2^1 Omega, to the power of h, and then you have a vector, I'm going to call a_t and b_t, which is just going to
be this vector value of your Theta t vector given the information up to the time t. It's going to
have two components, I'm just going to generically
call them a_t and b_t. When you take this
to the power of h using just
trigonometric results, you're going to get that J_2^1,Omega to the power of
h is just going to give you cosine of Omega h sine
of Omega h minus sine of Omega h cosine of Omega h. When you look
at this expression, you get something
that looks like this, and then you have, again, times these a_t, b_t. You're going to
have the cosine and sine only multiplied by this. In the end, you're going to have something that looks like this. You have this sinusoidal form with the period Omega in
your forecast function. You can also write this down in terms of an amplitude
that I'm going to call A_t and then a
phase that is B_t. Here again, you have
your periodicity that appears in this cosine wave. This is again for the
case in which you have a single frequency and the
frequencies in this range. There was a second
case that I mentioned, and that case is
the case in which the Omega is exactly Pi. In this case, your
Fourier representation is going to be your
model that has a state vector that is
just one dimensional. In the case where Omega
is between zero and Pi, you have a
two-dimensional state, vector here you're
going to have a one-dimensional state vector. This is going to
be your F and your G. Then you have again
whatever you want to put here as your v_t and W_t. This gives me, if I think
about the forecast function, h steps ahead is just going
to be something that has the form minus 1^h times a_t. Now I have a single component
here, is uni-dimensional. This is going to have
an oscillatory behavior between a_t and minus
a_t if I were to look h steps ahead forward
when I'm at time t. These two forms give me the single component
Fourier representation and using the
superposition principle, we will see that we can combine a single frequency and
the corresponding harmonics or several different
frequencies just using the superposition principle in the normal dynamic linear model. You can also incorporate more than one component in a
full Fourier representation. Usually the way this works is you have a fundamental period, let's say p. For example, if you are recording
monthly data, p could be 12 and then you are going to incorporate in the model the
fundamental frequency, and then all the
harmonics that go with that fundamental
frequency related to the period p. Here p, is the period and in this case, we are going to discuss essentially two
different situations. One is when p is an odd number, the other one is when
p is an even number. Let's begin with
the case of p is odd and in this
particular scenario, we can write down p
as 2 times m minus 1 for some value of m. This gives me a
period that is odd. How many frequencies I'm going to incorporate in this model? I'm going to be
able to write down Omega j as 2 Pi times j over p, which is the fundamental period. j here goes from one all
the way to m minus 1. Now we can use the
superposition principle thinking we have a component DLM representation for each of these frequencies. They are all going to
be between 0 and Pi. For each of them
I'm going to have that two-dimensional
DLM representation in terms of the state vector and then I can use the superposition principle
to concatenate them all and get a model that has
all these frequencies, the one related to the
fundamental period and all the harmonics for that. Again, if I think about
what is my F and my G here, I'm not writing down the t because both F and G are going
to be constant over time. So my F is going to be again, I concatenate as many E_2 as
I have frequencies in here. I'm going to have
E_2 transpose and so on and I'm going to have
m minus one of those. Times 2 gives me the dimension
of Theta t. The vector here is 2 times m minus
1 dimensional vector. My G is going to have that block diagonal structure where we are going to just have all
those J_2 1 Omega 1, all the way down to
the last harmonic. Each of these blocks is a
two-by-two matrix and I'm going to put them together
in a block diagonal form. This gives me the representation
when the period is odd, what is the structure of
the forecast function? Again, using the
superposition principle, the forecast function
is going to be just the sum of m
minus 1 components, where each of those
components is going to have an individual
forecast function that has that cosine
wave representation that we discussed before. Again, if I think about the forecast function
at time t h steps ahead, I will be able to write
it down like this. This should be a B. B_t,j. Again here, I have an amplitude for each
of the components and a phase for each of the
components so it depends on time but does not depend on h. The h enters here, and this is my
forecast function. In the case of P even the situation is
slightly different. But again, it's the same in terms of using the
superposition principle. In this case, we can write down P as 2 times m because
it's an even number. Now I can write down these Omega j's as a function of
the fundamental period. Again, this goes from
1 up to m minus 1. But there is a last
frequency here. When j is equal to m, this simplifies to be
the Nyquist frequency. In this case, I have my
Omega is equal to Pi. In this particular case, when I concatenate everything, I'm going to have again an F
and a G that look like this. Once again, I concatenate
all of these up to the component m minus 1. Then I have this 1 for
the last frequency. Then my G is going to
be the block diagonal. For the last frequency
I have that minus 1. This determines the dimension
of the state vector, in this case I'm going to have
2 times m minus 1 plus 1. My f function, my
forecast function, is again a function of the
number of steps ahead. I'm going to have the
same structure I had before for the m
minus 1 components. Then I have to add one more component that
corresponds to the frequency Pi. This one appears with the
power of h. As you can see, I'm using once again the
superposition principle to go from component representation to the full Fourier representation. In practice, once
we set the period, we can use a model that has the fundamental period and all the harmonics related
to that fundamental period. We could also use, discard some of those harmonics
and use a subset of them. This is one of the things that the Fourier
representation allows. It allows you to be
flexible in terms of how many components you
want to add in this model. There are other representations that are also used in practice. One of them is the seasonal
factors representation. In that case, you're
going to have a model in which the state vector has dimension p for a given period. It uses a G matrix that
is a permutation matrix. There is a correspondence
between this parameterization using the Fourier representation and that other parameterization. If you want to use
that parameterization, the way to interpret the
components of this state vector, since you have P of those, is going to be a representation
in terms of factors. For example, if you think
about monthly data, you will have the
say January factor, February factor, March
factor, and so on. You could think
about those effects and do a correspondence
with this particular model. We will always work
in this class with these representations
because it's more flexible. But again, you can go back and forth between one and the other.
