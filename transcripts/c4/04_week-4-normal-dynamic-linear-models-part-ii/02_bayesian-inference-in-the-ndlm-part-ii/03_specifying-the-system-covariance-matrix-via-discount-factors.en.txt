We have discussed different cases in
terms of the specification of the vt, the observational variance. Now, I will talk about how to
specify the system variance, assuming that that system variance
is not known just to recall the cases we have discussed,
suppose that we have a DLM. That looks like this,
so we have talked about the case in which vt and
Wt, the observation and system variances are known for
all the values of t. And we said that we can
perform filtering and smoothing in that case using
a normal prior distribution. We get results that are for
the filtering distributions, we also get normal distributions for
the smoothing distribution, we get normal distributions as well. Then we also discussed the case in which, so I guess, let me just clarify here, so we've done vt and Wt known for all t. Okay, we also said discussed the case in which we assume that vt is v, so it's constant over time v known and sorry, v unknown and Wt known for all t. Again, we can use a conjugated
structure for v unknown, we impose a normal inverse
gamma prior structure. And then we can obtain closed
form filtering equations and smoothing equations in
that particular case. But we're assuming here that all the Wts, the system covariance
matrices are unknown. Now we are going to discuss the case
in which the Wt is unknown, so how do we deal with this? So I'll begin with assuming
that vt is known for all t and we will discuss then what happens if the vt is unknown and now I want to specify my Wt. So if you recall when we were working with the equations of the normal
dynamic linear model. There was the variance
of the state vector theta_t that the given the information
we have up to t- 1. And if you remember the equations, we had two components in here, we had called that Rt and that Rt has Gt, Ct- 1, Gt transpose plus Wt. I'm going to call this first
component here in this nation, I'm going to call it Pt and
I can think of this Pt as the variance, the prior variance of
theta_t given Dt- 1. If I were to consider a model
in which this Wt is just zero, in other words, a model in which
there is no additional stochastic component in each time
at the system level. So in this case, if I call Pt ,Gt, Ct- 1, Gt transpose corresponds to the prior variance in a model of the form Ft, Gt, vt and then I have a zero here. So there is no so fast, there are no
stochastic changes which is equivalent to saying that there are no changes over
time in the parameters of the model. In the state, parameters of the model. A way to specify then my WT here, which
is what I want to do in this particular case is to assume that my Rt,
my prior variance in the general model. The variance of theta_t given
Dt-1 is this Pt component but I'm going to increase the uncertainty
when I think about that variance. So I'm going to say that my Rt is just going to be Pt divided by delta with delta. some factor here that I'm going to call
discount factor that is between zero and one. And I'm including the one here
when delta is exactly one, what I'm doing is I'm saying
there is no stochastic component. I'm going to be having
essentially my variance for theta_t given Dt-1 corresponds to the
variance of model that looks like this. And in that case, the parameters of the
model are not changing over time, I don't have any changes over time, every, all
the parameters stay the same over time. That's the case in which delta is equal
to one and if delta is smaller than one, what I'm doing here by dividing
by this delta factor is. I am increasing the uncertainty with
respect to whatever I had in t- 1, so the closer delta is to zero
the more uncertainty I'm going to have. And therefore the more variation I'm going
to have in the parameters of the model, the closer delta is to one, the less variation I'm going to
have in the model parameters. So if I were to now
combine this expression with also this expression, right, what I get, so
if I say Rt is Pt plus Wt but it's also Pt divided by delta. What I get here is that
Wt is fully specified as 1 minus delta divided by delta Pt, so I have an expression now for Wt that is given in terms of
this discount factor and my Pt. If you look at the expression for Pt,
Pt always depends on Gt Ct-1 and Gt transpose here, so
you only need the Gt and Ct-1. The first time you compute that
is when you consider P1, which is just,
you're going to use your G1, your C0, which is your prior variance for
the state vector. And that one you provide and this is
something that the modeler provides, the user provides and then you have the G. So once you have this P1,
you plug it in here and you're going to have the W1 and you
can continue going through this process, you continue with your
filtering equations. All you need is this C0 and
the discount factor to fully specify the Wt,
in the case, so this is again for the case in which Vt is known for
all time t, for all the times t. And you are specifying wt in this way, you can also consider
the case in which the W, the vt is constant and unknown. So there is the case in
which vt is v with v unknown and the structure in this case for the model is going to be very similar, you can just specify the discount
factor in the same way. Now, instead of having Wt, if you go
back to the equations that we discussed, you're going to have a Wtstar. And the Wt star,
you can write down in terms of a P star, where the P star is going to be Gt,
Ct minus one star Gt. So again, everything comes here with
a star, that is just writing that model in terms of the conjugate
structure as we described before. So, here, you can fully specify Wt star as one minus delta, divided by delta and then you have that Pt star with and Pt star is going to be given by Gt, Ct- 1 star, Gt transpose. And again, this provides the structure for
the Wt star, now, you write down your model,
your equations conditional on v. You have the normal distributions for
the state vector and then you also impose a prior distribution
of v that is an inverse comma. And then go through your equations
again for the filtering and smoothing and as we described before. So once again, all you need here
is you need your CO star and your discount factor and you have
your specification for the Wt star. So how do we choose that
discount factor in practice, we have delta in (0,1], so
that's what the theory says and I have to pick a particular
value in practice. How do we proceed if I have a model and what is the ideal discount factor value
that I can use to specify that Wt matrix. Again, in practice,
the first thing that happens is we usually consider discount factor
values that are above .8. So usually we just work,
it's not always the case but usually we consider discount
factor values that are above .8. So you can think of
just considering a grid of values in the interval .8 to 1,
including the one and then find a method that allows
you to pick that value optimally. You could use different kinds of
properties of the model to do this. In particular, you can use the one
step ahead predictive distributions to give you an idea of what is the best
discount factor value you can take. So you can write down if you
think about the predictive distributions, you can write down p. So you have all your data here and
then you have the information at, time zero and then you have
specified a particular DLM with an Ft, Gt and so on. And then when you write this down, you can write this down as a product
of those one step ahead densities here. So if you take the log and this,
let me just write down that this is also going to depend on whatever
discount factor you have for that particular model specification. So if I take the log of this and
you can write this p here inside as a product
of the individual wise. And so when you take the log, you're going to have the sum
of the logs from one or 2 capital T of the log of these p,
yt, Dt minus one. And then this also depends on delta, so this is the one step ahead
predictive distribution. So you have those densities and
it's going to be a function of delta in the case of a model in which you know,
vt and Wt for all the values of t. You know that those
are normal in the case here, we're specifying Wt
using a discount factor, so I'm going to have a normal
density if I have vt known. So I can look at this as a function of, let's call it l of delta
as a function of delta and I can view this as
a likelihood function for delta, so
if I evaluate this in a grid of values. I can pick the so called optimal delta by maximizing and depending on whether or not you're using a model with the vt known or a model in which vt is v. But v is unknown and
you have the conjugate prior structure, you're going to have normal
distributions in the first case here and students distributions in the second case. But you can compute this for each value of
delta, if you have a grid of values, you just pick the optimal delta to be this,
the one that maximizes this function. This is not the only function you
could use, you could also consider other alternatives, you could consider,
so this is one option. You have another option in which
you can write down a mean square error again as a function of the discount
factor for each model that you specify. And you can write down this as, over T, so here, I'm writing et as you remember, it's just that whatever you observe minus the prediction you get from your model is usually ft. But that prediction depends on delta, so that's why I'm writing down et
as a function of this delta. So here you could pick the optimal discount factor by minimizing this mean square error, so here the optimal delta is chosen by minimizing this function of delta. You could also use other measurements, like the mean absolute deviation and
then again minimize this. There are other approaches
that could be using practice, you could consider that delta is
another parameter in your model. You could put a prior on the delta and you can try to get inference
on that value and then again, another thing you could do is if you
have multiple components in your model. You could use a discount factor that
is dependent on the components, so you could have as many discount
factors as components in your model. And use the same idea to specify the W
matrix in this block diagonal form, if you were to do that instead of
having a function that is just, is univariant on delta. You will have multiple deltas and you will have to pick the optimal
values by maximizing that function. Or in the case of the MSE, you will
have to pick the optimal values of those deltas by minimizing these functions,
so there is multiple alternatives. In this course, we are going to be working
only with a single discount factor and we can pick the optimal
either using this method or this other method that I just described.
