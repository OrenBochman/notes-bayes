This is the conclusion of the course: Although we have stuck with some of the most common model types in this course. You now have the skill set to dream up, create, and put into practice sophisticated models, which you can apply to your data. We hope this course will become a helpful resource as you gain experience and encounter new problems. If you want to continue building your Bayesian toolbox, we recommend starting with some of the resources listed for further reading. You will find these references included in this module. Some important topics addressed are how to handle missing or censored data, modeling multivariate responses, and nonlinear models. You may also want to explore some of the applications of hierarchical models listed in module four. Don't forget also to explore your options with modeling software. We have included a reading in module two, which reviews several options available to you. We hope you've enjoyed this course and that the concepts we've explored together will empower you to turn your data into an asset to confidently make informed decisions.
