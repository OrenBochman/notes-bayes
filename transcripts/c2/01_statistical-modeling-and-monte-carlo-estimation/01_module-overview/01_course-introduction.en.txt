[MUSIC] Hello, I'm Matt Heiner,
a Doctoral Student of Statistics and Applied Mathematics at the University
of California, Santa Cruz. After assisting Professor Herbie Lee in
bringing you the first course in this series, I'm excited to present to you
the second course on Bayesian Statistics. Welcome to the class. The next step in your development as
a Bayesian statistician is a crucial one. Real world data involving
multiple variables often require more complex models
to reach realistic conclusions. As we encounter more
widely applicable models. We will need advanced computational
techniques to fit them. This course will introduce
Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Often referred to as MCMC methods,
which allow sampling from posterior distribution that
have no analytical solution. These methods have revolutionized
Bayesian statistics because they vastly expand the possibilities of
models that are available to us. In this course, we will build on the fundamentals that
were introduced in Professor Lee's course. We will assume that you have completed
that course using r for your calculations. Or that you have a basic familiarity
with Bayesian concepts and can do some basic programming in r. If you're out of practice in these or in
calculus-based probability, don't worry. We'll review important skills as
they do come necessary in our work. The courses organized into five modules. In the first module,
we will discuss statistical modelling and review how to approach your problem
from a Bayesian perspective. We will also introduce the concept
of using probabilistic stimulation to approximate quantities that
are difficult to compute directly. The second module is dedicated
to introducing MCMC. We will describe and demonstrate
two algorithms that have brought Bayesian statistics into the mainstream. We will also introduce Jags, an open source software which
implements MCMC for you. So that you can focus on modelling
rather than coding intricate algorithms. In the third module,
we'll begin modelling real data. Will demonstrate some of the most common
statical models including linear and logistic regression. In the fourth module we'll look
at regression for count data. And we'll introduce hierarchical modeling
as a way to account for correlated data. Throughout this demonstrations
will explore different techniques to adjust challenges
that often arise in data analysis. The last module contains
only in assignments. This assignment puts
you in the driver seat. It's your opportunity to bring
together all the pieces we've built throughout these two courses and conduct your own data analysis
on a project that you select. This peer reviewed assignment
is also your chance to practice communicating the methods
you use to solve a problem. It's also an important opportunity
to get feedback on your work and help others to improve their work. Each module has about 90 minutes
to two hours of video instruction. We recommend that you watch instructional
videos at the highest screen resolution. You can set this up option
by clicking on the gear icon in the lower right portion of the screen. We encouraged you to watch
the videos multiple times. The programming demonstration videos come
with code so that you can follow along. Many lessons come with
required background reading. Or optional supplementary reading which
may make the material more accessible. Each module comes with an honors quiz if
you're looking for a challenge or for extra practice. Also the honors sections
of modules three and four address additional topics
you might find interesting. In order to synthesize and solidify what
you learn it is necessary to get plenty of practice in an ordinary course we would
give you regular home work assignment. In the Coursera framework we provide
the homework problem as quizes. We encourage you to approach
the quizes as homework sets. Which may require reviewing the relevant
material, attempting to find a solution, returning again to the material and
correcting errors. If it takes a half hour or
more to complete a quiz You're probably approaching how we intended and
you'll get more out of this course. The problems may require several attempts,
but don't be discouraged we allow
multiple quiz attempts. Also we provide a lot of feedback
in the quizzes themselves, even if you get a problem correct. You may learn something
by reading the feedback. Again, welcome to the course. We hope this will be a rewarding
experience as you dive into applied Bayesian modeling and
broaden your analytical skill set. [MUSIC]
