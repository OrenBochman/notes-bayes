Suppose we flip a coin five times to estimate $θ$, the probability of obtaining heads. We use a Bernoulli likelihood for the data and a non-informative (and improper) $Beta(0,0)$ prior for $θ$. We observe the following sequence: (H, H, H, T, H).

Because we observed at least one H and at least one T, the posterior is proper. What is the posterior distribution for $\theta$

::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:


Beta(4,1)

We observed four "successes" and one "failure," and these counts are the parameters of the posterior beta distribution.

Continuing the previous question, what is the posterior mean for θ? Round your answer to one decimal place.

Consider again the thermometer calibration problem from Lesson 10.

Assume a normal likelihood with unknown mean θ and known variance $\sigma^2=0.25$. Now use the non-informative (and improper) flat prior for $θ$ across all real numbers. This is equivalent to a conjugate normal prior with variance equal to $\infty$.

You collect the following $n=5$ measurements: (94.6, 95.4, 96.2, 94.9, 95.9). What is the posterior distribution for $θ$?
:::

::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:


Recall from the lesson that with a flat prior on θ, the posterior distribution is

$$N(\bar{y},\frac{sigma^2}{n})=N(95.4,0.05)$$

Which of the following graphs shows the Jeffreys prior for a Bernoulli/binomial success probability p?

Hint: The Jeffreys prior in this case is Beta(1/2, 1/2).

::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:


Beta(1/2, 1/2).

Scientist A studies the probability of a certain outcome of an experiment and calls it θ. To be non-informative, he assumes a Uniform(0,1) prior for θ.

Scientist B studies the same outcome of the same experiment using the same data, but wishes to model the odds $ϕ= \frac{θ}{1−θ}$. Scientist B places a uniform distribution on $ϕ$. If she reports her inferences in terms of the probability $θ$, will they be equivalent to the inferences made by Scientist A?
:::

::: {.solution .callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution:


No, they did not use the Jeffreys prior.

The uniform prior on $θ$ implies the following prior PDF for

$$f(\phi)= \frac{1}{(1+\phi)^2} I_{\{\phi≥0\}}$$

​which is not the uniform prior used by Scientist B.

They would obtain equivalent inferences if they both use the Jeffrey's prior.
